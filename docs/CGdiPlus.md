# GdiPlus

GDI+ is the successor to GDI, the graphics device interface included with earlier versions of Windows. Windows XP or Windows .NET Server supports GDI for compatibility with existing applications, but programmers of new applications should use GDI+ for all their graphics needs because GDI+ optimizes many of the capabilities of GDI and also provides additional features.

A graphics device interface, such as GDI+, allows application programmers to display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device. The application programmer makes calls to the provided functions and those functions in turn make the appropriate calls to specific device drivers. GDI+ insulates the application from the graphics hardware, and it is this insulation that allows developers to create device-independent applications.

**Include file**: CGdiPlus.inc.

# CGpBase class

Initializes the GDI+ library and keeps a reference count of it. The destructor shutdowns the library. All the other GDI+ classes inherit frrom CGpBase.

### GetLastStatus method

Returns a value that indicates the nature of this object's most recent method failure.

```
FUNCTION GetLastStatus () AS GpStatus
```

#### Return value

Returns an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If no methods invoked on this object have failed since the previous call to GetLastStatus, then GetLastStatus returns **Ok** (0). If at least one method has failed since the previous call to GetLastStatus, then GetLastStatus returns a value that indicates the nature of the most recent failure.

For a detailed list of status codes see the **Status** enumeration.

# <a name="BitmapData"></a>BitmapData Structure

A **BitmapData** structure stores attributes of a bitmap. Used by the **GdipBitmapLockBits** and **GdipBitmapUnlockBits** functions.

```
TYPE BitmapData
   Width AS UINT
   Height AS UINT
   Stride AS INT_
   PixelFormat AS PixelFormat
   Scan0 AS ANY PTR
   Reserved AS UINT_PTR
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Width** | Number of pixels in one scan line of the bitmap. |
| **Height** | Number of scan lines in the bitmap. |
| **Stride** | Offset, in bytes, between consecutive scan lines of the bitmap. If the stride is positive, the bitmap is top-down. If the stride is negative, the bitmap is bottom-up. |
| **PixelFormat** | Integer that specifies the pixel format of the bitmap. |
| **Scan0** | Pointer to the first (index 0) scan line of the bitmap. |
| **Reserved** | Reserved for future use. |

# <a name="CharacterRange"></a>CharacterRange Structure

A **CharacterRange** structure specifies a range of character positions within a string.

```
TYPE CharacterRange
   First AS INT_
   Length AS INT_
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **First** | Specifies the first position of this range. |
| **Length** | Specifies the number of positions in this range. |

#### Remarks

A character range is a range of character positions within a string of text. The area of the display that is occupied by a group of characters that are specified by the character range is the bounding region. A character range is set by **GdipSetStringFormatMeasurableCharacterRanges**. The number of ranges that are currently set can be determined by calling **GdipGetStringFormatMeasurableCharacterRangeCount**. This number is also the number of regions expected to be obtained by the **GdipMeasureCharacterRanges** function.

# <a name="ColorMap"></a>ColorMap Structure

The **ColorMap** structure contains two COLORREF values. Several of the **ImageAttributes** functions adjust image colors by using a color remap table, which is an array of **ColorMap** structures.

```
TYPE ColorMap
   oldColor AS Color
   newColor AS Color
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **oldColor** | The original color. |
| **newColor** | The new color. |

#### Remarks

Because the FreeBasic 32-bit headers don't define the GDI+ **ColorMap** structure ad use the GDI **ColorMap** one, that has different member names, there is a conflict. To solve it, I have defined an union that can be used to replace **ColorMap** in both 32 and 64-bit.

```
UNION GDIP_COLORMAP
   ' // For compatibility with GDI+
   TYPE
      oldColor AS COLORREF
      newColor AS COLORREF
   END TYPE
   ' // For compatibility with GDI
   TYPE
      from AS COLORREF
      to AS COLORREF
   END TYPE
END UNION
```

# <a name="ColorMatrix"></a>ColorMatrix Structure

The **ColorMap** structure contains two COLORREF values. Several of the **ImageAttributes** functions adjust image colors by using a color remap table, which is an array of **ColorMap** structures.

```
TYPE ColorMatrix
   m(0 to 5-1, 0 to 5-1) AS REAL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **m** | 55 array of real numbers. |

#### Remarks

A 55 color matrix is a homogeneous matrix for a 4-space transformation. The element in the fifth row and fifth column of a 55 homogeneous matrix must be 1, and all of the other elements in the fifth column must be 0. Color matrices are used to transform color vectors. The first four components of a color vector hold the red, green, blue, and alpha components (in that order) of a color. The fifth component of a color vector is always 1.

# <a name="ColorPalette"></a>ColorPalette Structure

The **ColorPalette** structure defines an array of colors that make up a color palette. The colors are 32-bit ARGB colors.

```
TYPE ColorPalette
   Flags AS UINT
   Count AS UINT

END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Flags** | Combination of flags from the **PaletteFlags** enumeration. |
| **Count** | Number of elements in the Entries array. |
| **Entries** | Array of ARGB colors.  |

# <a name="EncoderParameter"></a>EncoderParameter Structure

An **EncoderParameter** structure holds a parameter that can be passed to an image encoder. An **EncoderParameter** structure can also be used to receive a list of possible values supported by a particular parameter of a particular image encoder.

```
TYPE EncoderParameter
   Guid AS GUID
   NumberOfValues AS ULONG
   Type AS ULONG
   Value AS ANY PTR
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Guid** | Identifies the parameter category. GUIDs that represent various parameter categories (**EncoderCompression**, **EncoderColorDepth**, and the like) are defined in Gdiplusimaging.inc. |
| **NumberOfValues** | Number of values in the array pointed to by the **Value** data member. |
| **Type** | Identifies the data type of the parameter. The **EncoderParameterValueType** enumeration in Gdiplusenums.inc defines several possible value types. |
| **Value** | Pointer to an array of values. Each value has the type specified by the **Type** data member. |

# <a name="EncoderParameters"></a>EncoderParameters Structure

An **EncoderParameters** structure is an array of **EncoderParameter** structures along with a data member that specifies the number of **EncoderParameter** structures in the array.

```
TYPE EncoderParameters
   Count AS UINT
   Parameter(0) AS EncoderParameter
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Count** | Number of **EncoderParameter** structures in the array. |
| **Parameter ()** | Array of **EncoderParameter** structures. |

#### Remarks

When you create an **EncoderParameters** structure, you must allocate enough memory to hold all of the **EncoderParameter** structures that will eventually be placed in the array.

# <a name="ENHMETAHEADER3"></a>ENHMETAHEADER3 Structure

The **ENHMETAHEADER3** structure contains enhanced-metafile data including the dimensions of the metafile image, the number of records in the metafile, and the resolution of the device on which the metafile was created.

```
TYPE ENHMETAHEADER3
   itype AS DWORD
   nSize AS DWORD
   rclBounds AS RECTL
   rclFrame AS RECTL
   dSignature AS DWORD
   nVersion AS DWORD
   nBytes AS DWORD
   nRecords AS DWORD
   nHandles AS WORD
   sReserved AS WORD
   nDescription AS DWORD
   offDescription AS DWORD
   nPalEntries AS DWORD
   szlDevice AS SIZEL
   szlMillimeters AS SIZEL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **iType** | Record type. Value is always EMR_HEADER. |
| **nSize** | Structure size, in bytes. This may be greater than the value returned by SIZEOF (ENHMETAHEADER3). |
| **rclBounds** | Bounding rectangle, in device units, for the image stored in the metafile. |
| **rclFrame** | Rectangle, in 0.01 millimeter units, that surrounds the image stored in the metafile. |
| **dSignature** | Must be ENHMETA_SIGNATURE. |
| **nVersion** | Version number of the metafile format. The current version is &H10000. |
| **nBytes** | Size, in bytes, of the metafile. |
| **nRecords** | Number of records in the metafile. |
| **nHandles** | Number of handles in the metafile handle table. Handle index zero is reserved. |
| **sReserved** | Reserved. Must be zero. |
| **nDescription** | Number of characters in the string that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This member is 0 if the metafile does not have a description string. |
| **offDescription** | Offset from the beginning of the ENHMETAHEADER3 structure to the string that contains the description of the metafile's contents. This member is 0 if the metafile does not have a description string. |
| **nPalEntries** | Number of entries in the metafile palette. |
| **szlDevice** | Resolution, in pixels, of the reference device. |
| **szlMillimeters** | Resolution, in millimeters, of the reference device. |

# <a name="GdiplusStartupInput"></a>GdiplusStartupInput Structure

The **GdiplusStartupInput** structure holds a block of arguments that are required by the **GdiplusStartup** function.

```
TYPE GdiplusStartupInput
   GdiplusVersion AS UINT32
   DebugEventCallback AS DebugEventProc
   SuppressBackgroundThread AS BOOL
   SuppressExternalCodecs AS BOOL
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **GdiplusVersion** | Specifies the version of Microsoft Windows GDI+. Must be 1. |
| **DebugEventCallback** | Pointer to a callback function that GDI+ can call, on debug builds, for assertions and warnings. The default value is NULL. |
| **SuppressBackgroundThread** | Boolean value that specifies whether to suppress the GDI+ background thread. If you set this member to TRUE, GdiplusStartup returns (in its output parameter) a pointer to a hook function and a pointer to an unhook function. You must call those functions appropriately to replace the background thread. If you do not want to be responsible for calling the hook and unhook functions, set this member to FALSE. The default value is FALSE. |
| **SuppressExternalCodecs** | Boolean value that specifies whether you want GDI+ to suppress external image codecs. GDI+ version 1.0 does not support external image codecs, so this parameter is ignored. |

#### Remarks

The **GdiplusStartupInput** structure provides a constructor that sets the **GdiplusVersion** member to 1 and allows you to specify values for the other three members. All of the constructor parameters are optional, so you can declare a variable of type GdiplusStartupInput without passing any arguments to the constructor, and all of the members will be initialized with appropriate default values.

If you set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the **GdiplusStartupinput** parameter to TRUE, you must call the hook and unhook functions returned in the output parameter. Call those functions before and after the application's main message loop; that is, a message loop that is active for the lifetime of GDI+. Call the hook function before the loop starts, and call the unhook function after the loop ends.

# <a name="GdiplusStartupOutput"></a>GdiplusStartupOutput Structure

The **GdiplusStartup** function uses the **GdiplusStartupOutput** structure to return (in its output parameter) a pointer to a hook function and a pointer to an unhook function. If you set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the input parameter to TRUE, then you are responsible for calling those functions to replace the Microsoft Windows GDI+ background thread.

Call the hook and unhook functions before and after the application's main message loop; that is, a message loop that is active for the lifetime of GDI+. Call the hook function before the loop starts, and call the unhook function after the loop ends. The token parameter of the hook function receives an identifier that you should later pass to the unhook function. If you do not pass the proper identifier (the one returned by the hook function) to the unhook function, there will be resource leaks that won't be cleaned up until the process exits.

If you do not want to be responsible for calling the hook and unhook functions, set the **SuppressBackgroundThread** member of the input parameter (passed to **GdiplusStartup**) to FALSE.

```
TYPE GdiplusStartupOutput
   NotificationHook AS NotificationHookProc
   NotificationUnhook AS NotificationUnhookProc
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **NotificationHook** | Receives a pointer to a hook function. |
| **NotificationUnhook** | Receives a pointer to an unhook function. |

# <a name="GpPathData"></a>GpPathData Structure

The **GpPathData** structure is used by the **GdipGetPathData** function. It has an array of points and an array of types. Each element in the array of types is a byte that specifies the point type and a set of flags for the corresponding element in the array of points. You can use a **GpathData** structure to get or set the data points (and their types) of a path.

```
TYPE GpPathData
   Count AS INT_
   Points AS GpPointF PTR
   Types AS BYTE PTR
END TYPE
```
-also-
```
type GpPathData as any
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **NotificationHook** | Receives a pointer to a hook function. |
| **NotificationUnhook** | Receives a pointer to an unhook function. |

#### Remarks

Because of another mess in the FreeBASIC Gdi+ headers, this structure can't be used with 32 and 64-bit at the same time. Therefore, I have declared a replacement in AfxGdiPlus.inc.

```
TYPE GDIP_PATHDATA

#### Remarks

Metafiles provide a device-independent and application-independent way to share pictures. They contain records that describe a sequence of graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) to invoke in a particular order with their associated graphics data. Metafiles can be recorded by an application and later played back by that application or by another one to reproduce a particular picture. They can also be used to send content to a print spooler. Enhanced metafiles support the ability to provide both Microsoft Windows GDI+ and Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) descriptions of the same picture so that both GDI+ and down-level GDI applications can render it.

# <a name="WmfPlaceableFileHeader"></a>WmfPlaceableFileHeader Structure

The **WmfPlaceableFileHeader** structure defines the fields of a placeable metafile header. Placeable metafiles were created as a way of specifying how a metafile is mapped and scaled on a display device.

```
TYPE WmfPlaceableFileHeader
   Key AS UINT32
   Hmf AS INT16
   BoundingBox AS PWMFRect16
   Inch AS INT16
   Reserved AS UINT32
   Checksum AS INT16
END TYPE
```

| Member     | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **Key** | Identification value that indicates the presence of a placeable metafile header. This value is always &h9AC6CDD7. |
| **Hmf** | Handle to the metafile in memory. When written to disk, this field is not used and will always contains the value 0. |
| **BoundingBox** | Destination rectangle, measured in twips, for displaying the metafile. |
| **Inch** | Number of twips per inch used to represent the image.<br>Normally, there are 1440 twips per inch; however, this number can be changed to scale the image.<br>* A value of 720 specifies that the image is twice its normal size.<br>* A value of 360 specifies that the image is four times its normal size.<br>* A value of 2880 specifies that the image is half its normal size. |
| **Reserved** | Not used and is always set to 0. |
| **Checksum** | Checksum for the previous 10 WORDs in the header. This value can be used to determine whether the metafile has become corrupted. |

#### Remarks

Although placeable metafiles are quite common, they are not directly supported by the Microsoft Windows application programming interface (API). To display a placeable metafile using the Windows API, you must first strip the placeable metafile header from the file. This is typically performed by copying the metafile to a temporary file starting at file offset 22 (0x16). This is because each placeable metafile begins with a 22-byte header that is followed by a standard metafile. 

# <a name="BrushType"></a>BrushType Enumeration

The **BrushType** enumeration indicates the type of brush. There are five types of brushes.

```
BrushTypeSolidColor = 0
BrushTypeHatchFill = 1
BrushTypeTextureFill = 2
BrushTypePathGradient = 3
BrushTypeLinearGradient = 4
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| **BrushTypeSolidColor** | Indicates a brush of type SolidBrush. A solid brush paints a single, constant color that can be opaque or transparent. |
| **BrushTypeHatchFill** | Indicates a brush of type **HatchBrush**. A hatch brush paints a background and paints, over that background, a pattern of lines, dots, dashes, squares, crosshatch, or some variation of these. The hatch brush consists of two colors: one for the background and one for the pattern over the background. The color of the background is called the background color, and the color of the pattern is called the foreground color.  |
| **BrushTypeTextureFill** | Indicates a brush of type **TextureBrush**. A texture brush paints an image. The image or texture is either a portion of a specified image or a scaled version of a specified image. The type of image (metafile or nonmetafile) determines whether the texture is a portion of the image or a scaled version of the image. |
| **BrushTypePathGradient** | Indicates a brush of type **PathGradientBrush**. A path gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes from a center point outward to a boundary that is defined by a closed curve or path. The color gradient has one color at the center point and one or multiple colors at the boundary. |
| **BrushTypeLinearGradient** | Indicates a brush of type **LinearGradientBrush**. A linear gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes evenly from the starting boundary line of the linear gradient brush to the ending boundary line of the linear gradient brush. The boundary lines of a linear gradient brush are two parallel straight lines. The color gradient is perpendicular to the boundary lines of the linear gradient brush, changing gradually across the stroke from the starting boundary line to the ending boundary line. The color gradient has one color at the starting boundary line and another color at the ending boundary line.  |

CompositingModeSourceCopy = 1
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| CompositingModeSourceOver | Specifies that when a color is rendered, it is blended with the background color. The blend is determined by the alpha component of the color being rendered. |
| CompositingModeSourceCopy | Specifies that when a color is rendered, it overwrites the background color. This mode cannot be used along with **TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit**. |

# <a name="CompositingQuality"></a>CompositingQuality Enumeration

| CompositingQualityHighQuality | Specifies that gamma correction is applied. |
| CompositingQualityGammaCorrected | Specifies that gamma correction is applied. |
| CompositingQualityAssumeLinear | Specifies that gamma correction is not applied. |

#### Remarks

When you specify that gamma correction should not be applied, the image data to be rendered (blended with the background) is assumed to be in a linear color space with a gamma value of 1.0. As a result, no gamma adjustment is applied to the image data before or after blending the image with the background.

When you specify that gamma correction should be applied, the image data to be rendered (blended with the background) is assumed to be in the sRGB color space with a gamma value of 2.2. To ensure accurate blending, the input image data is transformed into a linear (gamma = 1.0) space before the colors are blended and transformed back into sRGB (gamma = 2.2) space afterward. This mode results in a more accurate blend at the expense of additional processing time. 

# <a name="CoordinateSpace"></a>CoordinateSpace Enumeration

```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| DriverStringOptionsCmapLookup | Specifies that the positions of the glyphs are taken from a character map lookup table. If this flag is not set, the positions are taken from an array of coordinates. |
| DriverStringOptionsVertical | Specifies that the string is displayed vertically. |
| DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance | Specifies that the glyph positions are calculated from the position of the first glyph. If this flag is not set, the glyph positions are obtained from an array of coordinates. |
| DriverStringOptionsLimitSubpixel | Specifies that less memory should be used for cache of antialiased glyphs. This also produces lower quality. If this flag is set, more memory is used, but the quality is higher. |

# <a name="EmfToWmfBitsFlags"></a>EmfToWmfBitsFlags Enumeration

Specifies options for the **GdipEmfToWmfBits** method, which converts an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) metafile to a Microsoft Windows Metafile Format (WMF) metafile.

The bitmap is not permanently altered by the conversion to grayscale values; those values are calculated only for the purpose of creating the histogram. The grayscale histogram is written to the buffer pointed to by the channel0 parameter of the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function. The channel1, channel2, and channel3 parameters must be set to NULL. |
| HistogramFormatB | Specifies that the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function returns a histogram for the blue channel. The blue-channel histogram is written to the buffer pointed to by the channel0 parameter of the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function. The channel1, channel2, and channel3 parameters must be set to NULL. |
| HistogramFormatG | Specifies that the **GdipBitmapGetHistogram** function returns a histogram for the green channel.

HotkeyPrefixShow = 1
HotkeyPrefixHide = 2
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| HotkeyPrefixNone | Specifies that no hot key processing occurs. |
| HotkeyPrefixShow | Specifies that Unicode text is scanned for ampersands (&), which are interpreted as hot key markers in the same way as menu and dialog resources are processed in the Windows user interface. All pairs of ampersands are replaced by a single ampersand. All single ampersands are removed and the first character that follows the first single ampersand is displayed underlined. |
| HotkeyPrefixHide | Specifies that Unicode text is scanned for ampersands (&), which are substituted and removed as in HotkeyPrefixShow but no underline is shown. This option can be used when accessibility hot key underlines are not required. |

#### Remarks

Hot keys are keys that are programmed to provide keyboard shortcuts to functionality and are activated by pressing the ALT key. The keys are application dependent and are identified by an underscored letter, typically in a menu. An example would be the File menu with the letter F underscored. This makes the F key a hot key to launch the File menu.

# <a name="LineJoin"></a>LineJoin Enumeration

The **LineJoin** enumeration specifies how to join two lines that are drawn by the same pen and whose ends meet. At the intersection of the two line ends, a line join makes the join look more continuous. 

```
LineJoinMiter = 0
LineJoinBevel = 1
LineJoinRound = 2
LineJoinMiterClipped = 3
```

| Constant   | Meaning     |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| LineJoinMiter | Specifies a mitered join. This produces a sharp corner or a clipped corner, depending on whether the length of the miter exceeds the miter limit. |
| LineJoinBevel | Specifies a beveled join. This produces a diagonal corner. |
| LineJoinRound | Specifies a circular join. This produces a smooth, circular arc between the lines. |
| LineJoinMiterClipped | Specifies a mitered join. This produces a sharp corner or a beveled corner, depending on whether the length of the miter exceeds the miter limit. |

#### Remarks

The miter length is the distance from the intersection of the line walls on the inside of the join to the intersection of the line walls outside of the join. The miter length can be large when the angle between two lines is small. The miter limit is the maximum allowed ratio of miter length to stroke width. The default value is 10.0f.

When using **LineJoinMiter** and the actual ratio exceeds the miter limit, the corner is clipped perpendicular to the miter at a distance from the inner corner that is the product of the miter limit and the pen width. 

When using **LineJoinMiterClipped** and the miter limit is exceeded, the join is drawn as if its type were LineJoinBevel; that is, when the line walls on the inside of the join meet, then a joining line is drawn between the line walls on the outside of the join.
