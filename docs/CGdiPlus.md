# GdiPlus

GDI+ is the successor to GDI, the graphics device interface included with earlier versions of Windows. Windows XP or Windows .NET Server supports GDI for compatibility with existing applications, but programmers of new applications should use GDI+ for all their graphics needs because GDI+ optimizes many of the capabilities of GDI and also provides additional features.

A graphics device interface, such as GDI+, allows application programmers to display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device. The application programmer makes calls to the provided functions and those functions in turn make the appropriate calls to specific device drivers. GDI+ insulates the application from the graphics hardware, and it is this insulation that allows developers to create device-independent applications.

# CGpBase class

Initializes the GDI+ library and keeps a reference count of it. The destructor shutdowns the library. All the other GDI+ classes inherit frrom CGpBase.

### GetLastStatus method

Returns a value that indicates the nature of this object's most recent method failure.

```
FUNCTION GetLastStatus () AS GpStatus
```

#### Return value

Returns an element of the **Status** enumeration.

If no methods invoked on this object have failed since the previous call to GetLastStatus, then GetLastStatus returns **Ok** (0). If at least one method has failed since the previous call to GetLastStatus, then GetLastStatus returns a value that indicates the nature of the most recent failure.

For a detailed list of status codes see the **Status** enumeration.
