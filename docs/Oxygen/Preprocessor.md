# Preprocessor Directives

Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements. They can be used to include headers or other source files, conditional compilation of blocks of code, define small inline functions (macros), alter how the compiler handles variables and parameter passing and other uses.

# <a name="alert"></a>#alert

Generates a compiler message (like an error).

Used to alert programmer about an area of code that requires attention.

#### Example

```
#alert (please implement methods for this interface)
```

# <a name="assign"></a>#assign

Emulates the C convention for the `=` operator.

When `assign` is on, `=` acts always as an assignment operator in conditional statements and `==` must be used to test equality.
 
#### Example

```
#assign on
if hresult = QueryInterface(gu, ob) then ...
```

# <a name="autodim"></a>#autodim

Enables variables to be created without a `dim` statement. The type is implied from the initializer expression.

#### Example

```
#autodim on
v = 123
print v
```

# <a name="blockdepth"></a>#blockdepth

Returns the nesting depth of a block at compile time.

This command was introduced to catch unclosed blocks which are often hard to trace.

#### Example

```
#blockdepth node x   ' use any descriptive label on the line
```
