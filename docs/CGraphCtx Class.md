# CGraphCtx Class

**CGraphCtx** is a graphic control for pictures, text and graphics. You can use both GDI and GDI+ to draw graphics and text and to load and manipulate images. Optionally, you can add support for OpenGL by passing "OPENGL" in the caption.

This control features persistence and uses a virtual buffer (set initially equal to the size of the control when it is created) to allow to display images bigger than the size of the control. Scrollbars are automatically added when the size of the virtual buffer is bigger than the size of the control and removed when unneeded. It also features keyboard navigation and sends command messages to the parent window or dialog when the return or Escape keys are pressed, and notification messages for mouse clicks.

To use the control, include the CGraphCtx.inc file in your program and use the namespace **Afx**.

**Include file**: CGraphCtx.inc

# Constructor

Registers the class name and creates an instance of the control.

```
CONSTRUCTOR CGraphCtx (BYVAL pWindow AS CWindow PTR, BYVAL cID AS LONG_PTR, _
   BYREF wszTitle AS WSTRING = "", BYVAL x AS LONG = 0, BYVAL y AS LONG = 0, _
   BYVAL nWidth AS LONG = 0, BYVAL nHeight AS LONG = 0, BYVAL dwStyle AS DWORD = 0, _
   BYVAL dwExStyle AS DWORD = 0, BYVAL lpParam AS LONG_PTR = 0)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pWindow* | Pointer to the CWindow class of the parent window. |
| *cID* | Control identifier. |
| *wszTitle* | The window caption. If "OPENGL" is used as the caption, support for OpenGL is added to the control. |
| *x* | The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the window relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. |
| *y* | The initial y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the window relative to the upper-left corner of the parent window's client area. |
| *nWidth* | The width of the control. |
| *nHeight* | The height of the control. |
| *dwStyle* | The style of the window being created. Pass -1 to use the default styles. |
| *dwExStyle* | The extended window style of the control being created. Pass -1 to use the default styles. |
| *lpParam* | Pointer to custom data. |
