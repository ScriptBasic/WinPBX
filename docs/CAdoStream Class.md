# CAdoStream Class

Represents a stream of binary data or text.

**Include file**: CAdoStream.inc (include CADODB.inc)

#### Remarks

In tree-structured hierarchies such as a file system or an e-mail system, a **Record** may have a default binary stream of bits associated with it that contains the contents of the file or the e-mail. A **Stream** object can be used to manipulate fields or records containing these streams of data. A **Stream** object can be obtained in these ways:

From a URL pointing to an object (typically a file) containing binary or text data. This object can be a simple document, a **Record** object representing a structured document, or a folder.
By opening the default **Stream** object associated with a **Record** object. You can obtain the default stream associated with a **Record** object when the **Record** is opened, to eliminate a round-trip just to open the stream.
By instantiating a **Stream** object. These **Stream** objects can be used to store data for the purposes of your application. Unlike a **Stream** associated with a URL, or the default **Stream** of a **Record**, an instantiated **Stream** has no association with an underlying source by default.

With the methods and properties of a **Stream** object, you can do the following:

* Open a **Stream** object from a **Record** or URL with the **Open** method.
* Close a **Stream** with the **Close** method.
* Input bytes or text to a **Stream** with the **Write** and **WriteText** methods.
* Read bytes from the **Stream** with the **Read** and **ReadText** methods.
* Write any **Stream** data still in the ADO buffer to the underlying object with the **Flush** method.
* Copy the contents of a **Stream** to another **Stream** with the **CopyTo** method.
* Control how lines are read from the source file with the **SkipLine** method and the **LineSeparator** property.
* Determine the end of stream position with the **EOS** property and **SetEOS** method.
* Save and restore data in files with the **SaveToFile** and **LoadFromFile** methods.
* Specify the character set used for storing the **Stream** with the **Charset** property.
* Halt an asynchronous **Stream** operation with the **Cancel** method.
* Determine the number of bytes in a **Stream** with the **Size** property.
* Control the current position within a **Stream** with the **Position** property.
* Determine the type of data in a **Stream** with the **Type_** property.
* Determine the current state of the **Stream** (closed, open, or executing) with the **State** property.
* Specify the access mode for the **Stream** with the **Mode** property.

# <a name="Attach"></a>Attach

Attaches a reference to an ADO **Stream** object to the class, allowing to call the methods and properties of its interface.

```
SUB Attach (BYVAL pStream AS Afx_ADOStream PTR, BYVAL fAddRef AS BOOLEAN = FALSE)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pStream* | A pointer to an ADO **Stream** interface. |
| *fAddRef* | TRUE = increase the reference count; FALSE = don't increase the reference count. |

# <a name="Cancel"></a>Cancel

Cancels execution of a pending, asynchronous method call.

```
FUNCTION Cancel () AS HRESULT
```

#### Return value

S_OK (0) or an HRESULT code.

#### Remarks

Use the **Cancel** method to terminate execution of an asynchronous method call (that is, a method invoked with the **adAsyncConnect**, **adAsyncExecute**, or **adAsyncFetch** option).

For a **Stream** object, the last asynchronous call to the **Open** method is terminated.

# <a name="Charset"></a>Charset

Cancels execution of a pending, asynchronous method call.

```
PROPERTY Charset () AS CBSTR
PROPERTY Charset (BYREF cbsCharset AS CBSTR)
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *cbsCharset* | CBSTR. A value that specifies the character set into which the contents of the **Stream** will be translated. The default value is "Unicode". Allowed values are typical strings passed over the interface as Internet character set strings (for example, "iso-8859-1", "Windows-1252", etc.). For a list of the character set strings that is known by a system, see the subkeys of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Charset in the Windows Registry. |

#### Return value

CBSTR. The character set.

#### Remarks

In a text **Stream** object, text data is stored in the character set specified by the **Charset** property. The default is Unicode. The **Charset** property is used for converting data going into the **Stream** or coming out of the **Stream**. For example, if the **Stream** contains ISO-8859-1 data and that data is copied to a **BSTR**, the **Stream** object will convert the data to Unicode. The reverse is also true.

For an open **Stream**, the current **Position** must be at the beginning of the **Stream** (0) to be able to set **Charset**.

**Charset** is used only with text **Stream** objects (**Type_** is **adTypeText**). This property is ignored if **Type_** is **adTypeBinary**.

# <a name="Close"></a>Close

Closes a **Stream** object and any dependent objects.

```
FUNCTION Close () AS HRESULT
```

#### Return value

S_OK (0) or an HRESULT code.

# <a name="CopyTo"></a>CopyTo

Copies the specified number of characters or bytes (depending on **Type_**) in the **Stream** to another **Stream** object.

```
FUNCTION CopyTo (BYVAL pDestStream AS ADOStream PTR, BYVAL CharNumber AS LONG = adReadAll) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pDestStream* | An object variable value that contains a reference to an open **Stream** object. The current **Stream** is copied to the destination **Stream** specified by *pDestStream*. The destination Stream must already be open. If not, a run-time error occurs. **Note**: The *pDestStream* parameter may not be a proxy of **Stream** object because this requires access to a private interface on the **Stream** object that cannot be remoted to the client. |
| *CharNumber* | Optional. An Integer value that specifies the number of bytes or characters to be copied from the current position in the source **Stream** to the destination **Stream**. The default value is *adReadAll* (-1), which specifies that all characters or bytes are copied from the current position to **EOS**. |

#### Return value

CBSTR. The character set.

#### Remarks

This method copies the specified number of characters or bytes, starting from the current position specified by the **Position** property. If the specified number is more than the available number of bytes until **EOS**, then only characters or bytes from the current position to **EOS** are copied. If the value of *NumChars* is â€“1, or omitted, all characters or bytes starting from the current position are copied.

If there are existing characters or bytes in the destination stream, all contents beyond the point where the copy ends remain, and are not truncated. Position becomes the byte immediately following the last byte copied. If you want to truncate these bytes, call **SetEOS**.

**CopyTo** should be used to copy data to a destination **Stream** of the same type as the source **Stream** (their **Type_** property settings are both **adTypeText** or both **adTypeBinary**). For text **Stream** objects, you can change the **Charset** property setting of the destination **Stream** to translate from one character set to another. Also, text **Stream** objects can be successfully copied into binary **Stream objects**, but binary **Stream** objects cannot be copied into text **Stream** objects.

# <a name="EOS"></a>EOS

Indicates whether the current position is at the end of the stream.

```
FUNCTION EOS () AS BOOLEAN
```

#### Return value

A Boolean value that indicates whether the current position is at the end of the stream. **EOS** returns True if there are no more bytes in the stream; it returns False if there are more bytes following the current position.

To set the end of stream position, use the **SetEOS** method. To determine the current position, use the **Position** property.

# <a name="Flush"></a>Flush

Forces the contents of the **Stream** remaining in the ADO buffer to the underlying object with which the **Stream** is associated.

```
FUNCTION Flush () AS HRESULT
```

#### Return value

S_OK (0) or an HRESULT code.

#### Remarks

This method may be used to send the contents of the stream buffer to the underlying object (for example, the node or file represented by the URL that is the source of the **Stream** object). This method should be called when you want to ensure that all changes made to the contents of a **Stream** have been written. However, with ADO it is not usually necessary to call **Flush**, as ADO continuously flushes its buffer as much as possible in the background. Changes to the content of a **Stream** are made automatically, not cached until **Flush** is called.

Closing a **Stream** with the **Close** method flushes the contents of a **Stream** automatically; there is no need to explicitly call **Flush** immediately before **Close**.
