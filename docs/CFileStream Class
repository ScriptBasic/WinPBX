# CFileStream Class

Allows to work with binary file streams. A binary stream consists of one or more bytes of arbitrary information. You can write the value stored in an arbitrary object to a (byte-oriented) binary stream and read exactly what was stored in the object when you wrote it. CFileStream provides a stream for a file, allowing read, write and seek operations.
